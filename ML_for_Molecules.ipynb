    "This notebook has been designed to complement Miguel's lecture earlier this afternoon by demonstrating some of the concepts he discussed. We will begin by importing the associated dependencies to run this notebook, see the repo's README for details on how to get these installed. After this, we will then describe how one can manipulate molecules in [RDKIT](https://rdkit.org/), a popular chemoinformatics toolkit, of which no existing knowledge of is expected. We will then go on to implementing and testing the regression models on molecules Miguel described, namely MLP on fingerints, RNN/CNN on SMILES strings, and GNNs on the molecular graph. \n",

    "Tasks which you need to complete I have labelled with **🧪 Task #** , and the missing code location with `# ====== TASK -- FILL IN ======` in the code cell. Completing these will require some basic knowledge of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), if you haven't used this before you can go through the tutorial [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html) or read through the [docs](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html) as and when this is needed (I've tried to add links to relevant parts where appropriate). I wasn't sure on everyone's background so I apologize if this notebook is either too long or too short. To this end there are some optional tasks (marked with 🕰 ) which you can do later or simply ignore! I have also tried to include links at the end of each section for further reading. Finally, if you spot any bugs/typos (sorry  😳 ), please create a GitHub issue or PR and I can fix them!\n"

The string is created by printing out the nodes found on a traversal of the molecular graph. For our purposes it is not particularly important how this traversal happens but note how atoms are represented by their usual element symbol (i.e. carbon by 'C', oxygen by 'O', etc), bonds by the symbols `. - = # $ : / \\`, branching by parentheses, and rings by numbers. \n",

    "**RDKit** If you want to learn more about how to use RDKit, the RDKit [documentation](http://www.rdkit.org/docs/index.html) is great, in particular this [first rendered notebook](http://www.rdkit.org/docs/GettingStartedInPython.html) covers the majority of the stuff we have gone through here and far more! Also, whilst writing this notebook I spotted [this tweet](https://twitter.com/trjosephson/status/1296108489702424576?s=20), which has collected in its replies a collection of links to excellent resources. In particular, the (GitHub hosted) tutorials from [@PatWalters](https://github.com/PatWalters/workshop) and [@iwatobipen](https://github.com/iwatobipen/py4chemoinformatics) look amazing, and also cover regression on molecules which we shall investigate in the next section.\n",

    "We are using RDKit in this notebook as it has lots of well-documented features, works great with Python and is very popular for ML in Chemistry applications. I should also quickly point out that there are [other chemoinformatics toolkits out there](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheminformatics_toolkits), which may be useful if you prefer working in other programming languages. Examples that I have used include the [Chemistry Development Kit](https://cdk.github.io/) in Java , the [Indigo Toolkit](https://lifescience.opensource.epam.com/indigo/) with a core written in C++ (with Python bindings), and [OpenBabel](https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel). \n",

    "**Fingerprints** Morgan fingerprints (or circular fingerprints (Rogers et al., 2010)) are not the only way to compute fingerprints for molecules. [RDKit](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/GettingStartedInPython.html#list-of-available-fingerprints) has a series of other fingerprinting methods implemented. Choosing fingerprints could be an dataset dependent decision, although Rinker and Landrum (2013) find that many popular fingerprints offer fairly similar performance in downstream tasks."

    "\n",
    "In this section we looked at how to code up different regression models for molecules. In particular, we looked at NNs on fingerprints, CNN and RNNs on SMILES strings, and GNNs on molecular graphs. We tried to get some inutition for their performance and compute characteristics and offered pointers to how the basic implementations of each could be extended. I should quickly point out that we have not performed any extensive hyperparameter/architecture search or evaluated the models on more complicated datasets, both of which would be required in a more comprehensive comparison. If you wish to do this you could follow up on some of the extension tasks and consider some of the architectures/datasets used in the references provided!\n",
    "\n",
    "GNNs (and related models) have quite a long history in chemoinformatics, e.g. (Kireev, 1995; Merkwirth and Lengauer, 2005). They have also picked up a lot of interest recently in the ML community, where they have also been used to represent many other kinds of data such as physical systems, citation networks, knowledge graphs, or social networks (e.g. see (Kipf and Welling, 2017; Battaglia et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2020; Dai et al., 2017; Hamilton et al., 2017; Bronstein et al., 2016) and the references therein).  Battaglia et al.  (2018), especially §3-4, is well worth reading, as it unifies some of the existing approaches as does Gilmer et al. (2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we presented one pattern for implementing graph neural networks based on maintaing an edge list. This enabled the easy batching together of multiple graphs with different numbers of nodes (through the `concatenate` function you wrote). However, alternative patterns also have their own pros/cons, for instance you can store graphs as adjacency matrices and do the message passing step by matrix multiplication; you can find my code for playing around with such ideas [here](https://github.com/john-bradshaw/GNN). If you want well-documented, well-maintained libraries for working with GNNs, I recommend checking out [PyTorch Geometric](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric) or the [Deep Graph Library (DGL)](https://github.com/dmlc/dgl). You can see recent talks talking about what is new in these libraries at this [recent ICML workshop (time 3:42:42)](https://icml.cc/virtual/2020/workshop/5715)."
